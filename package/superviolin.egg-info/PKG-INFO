        ## Superviolin CLI commands
        
        `demo`
        This command creates a Violin SuperPlot using dummy data that ships with the package. Run superviolin demo from your command prompt after installation to be sure the package is working.
        
        `init`
        The superviolin init command generates an "args.txt" file in the current directory, which will be used to generate a Violin SuperPlot based on the Excel or csv file of your data located in the same folder using arguments specified in this text file.
        
        `plot`
        The superviolin plot command renders the Violin SuperPlot as a figure. This layout can be edited prior to saving.
        
        If any of these commands results in an error, **please email Martin Kenny** with a copy of:
        
        1. The data that caused the error
        
        2. The accompanying args.txt file
        
        3. A txt file containing the console output
        
        ## Superviolin with scripts
        You can also import the package into your own Python scripts. Simply import the`Superplot` class by running`from superviolin import Superplot`, and you can begin to automate generation of Violin SuperPlots or extend the `Superplot` class with your own customizations.
