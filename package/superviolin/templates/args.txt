# IMPORTANT: before trying to generate the superplot
# Users must change the "filename" and "data_format" arguments if using an "untidy" format. If the format is tidy,
# also change "condition", "value", and "replicate" to match the column names in your dataset.
# X and Y labels will not be plotted by default. Change these arguments according to your preference.

# csv file or Microsoft Excel file containing data in tidy data format. Include file extension in the name

# the label for the x axis. To have no label on the x axis, don't change the default value.

# The following arguments below may be changed as the user desires

# order of the experimental conditions from left to right
# must be separated by ", " e.g. Control, Drug
order: None

# use mean (default) or median to position the scatterpoints over each replicate
centre_val: mean

# use mean or median from each experimental replicate. Used to calculate the centre_val. Default: mean
middle_vals: mean

# standard deviation (SD, default) or 95% confidence interval (CI) if using median
error_bars: SD

# bandwidth of the fitted kernel density estimators. Determines smoothening of the
# stripes in each violin. "None" is the default value, which means an "optimal" # factor will be calculated
bw: None

# overlay statistics on plot. Only works for 2 or 3 conditions.
statistics: yes

# minimum and maximum y values to display on the y-axis e.g. 1, 5. Default value: None
